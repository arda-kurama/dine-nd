        <h1>Privacy Policy for DineND</h1>
        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> July 18, 2025</p>

        <h2>1. Overview</h2>
        <p>
            DineND is a mobile application that helps university students view
            dining hall menus and plan meals based on nutritional information.
            We are committed to respecting your privacy and minimizing data collection.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>
            DineND does not collect any personally identifiable information (PII). However,
            the app does use anonymous analytics to understand general usage patterns
            and improve functionality.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>No login or account creation is required.</li>
            <li>
                No name, email address, phone number, or device identifier is collected.
            </li>
            <li>
                A randomly generated ID is used to track anonymous sessions for analytics only.
            </li>
            <li>
                No data is linked to your identity or shared with advertisers.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Analytics</h2>
        <p>
            DineND uses a third-party analytics service (Statsig) to collect anonymous data about
            how users interact with the app. This includes:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Screens visited</li>
            <li>Items added to your plate</li>
            <li>Meal planning interactions</li>
            <li>Aggregate nutritional summaries</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This data helps us improve app performance, usability, and feature development.
            It is <strong>not shared</strong> with advertisers and is <strong>not used for tracking you across apps or websites</strong>.
        </p>

        <h2>4. AI Services</h2>
        <p>
            DineND uses <strong>OpenAI's GPT API</strong> to provide smart meal
            planning suggestions based on user input.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                This AI feature processes
                <em>only the text input you provide</em> during the session.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>No input is stored</strong> or linked to your identity.
            </li>
            <li>
                AI features are optional and are used solely to improve user
                experience.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Future Changes</h2>
        <p>
            If we introduce features that collect personal information or change
            how data is used, this policy will be updated accordingly. Users
            will be informed via the app or App Store listings.

        <p>
            Depending on your jurisdiction (e.g., California, Virginia), you may
            have rights regarding your data. Since we do not collect personal
